## Cpu-Python-Usertest

This is a simple CPU test.

To ensure cross-platform compatibility, we chose to use Python.

Two methods will be used to calculate pi.

By default, pi will be recalculated 50 times, and the second method will take progressively longer.

This is a significant test of CPU intensive calculations.

Warning: I am not responsible for any overheating or damage to your CPU during the test.

You are welcome to share your CPU test duration with us.
